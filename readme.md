There are three tough challenges in developing the web-based video editor for Touch:
- UX and touch input
- Video loading, sequencing and manipulation
- Effects, overlays, and transitions

Videos you can use for testing:
- [Street](https://www.theinternetoftouch.com/videos/street.zip) 
- [Human Flight](https://www.theinternetoftouch.com/videos/humanflight.zip) 
- [Nature](https://www.theinternetoftouch.com/videos/nature.zip) 
- [Trailer](https://www.theinternetoftouch.com/videos/trailer.zip)
